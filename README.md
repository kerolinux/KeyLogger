**Keylogger using pynput**

**Description:**

This Python script is a basic keylogger created using the `pynput` library. When executed, the script captures key presses and logs them to a file named "keyfile.txt." The `keyPressed` function handles key press events, printing the pressed key and appending it to the log file. The script runs indefinitely until interrupted, making it a simple educational tool for understanding keylogging mechanisms in Python.

**Usage:**

1. Install the required `pynput` library using `pip install pynput`.
2. Run the script to start logging key presses to "keyfile.txt."
3. Stop the script by interrupting it (e.g., pressing Ctrl+C).

**Disclaimer:**

This script is intended for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of keyloggers or any form of spying software is illegal and unethical. Use this script responsibly and only on systems for which you have explicit permission.
